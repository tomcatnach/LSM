# London Startup Marketing Workshop

Hey guys, we've had amazing feedback from our first paid workshop that we've decided to organise it again for those who missed it!

Our incredible first speaker is **Mark Colgan a Digital Marketing Specialist** who will present an interactive workshop on Content Marketing.

Content Marketing has become so important for business, that in 2016 you simply can not afford to not be doing it. Your customers are spending more time online researching for products and services before contacting businesses, so it is vital that you understand who they are, what challenges you can help them overcome and have the right tools and processes in place to capture their information and convert leads into sales.

- Do you know who your customers are?
- Do you know where they are spending time online?
- Does your current content map to the sales funnel?
- Are you generating the number of leads and closing sales that you need to sustain your business?
- If you can not answer the questions above, then sign up to the Content Marketing workshop by clicking at the top of this page (limited tickets available so hurry up).

### At the workshop you will learn:

1. What buyer persona's are and how you create them
2. The stages of the sales funnel and how to map your content to this
3. Suggestions on how to come up with content ideas that is right for your audience
4. Tools and tactics you can use to encourage prospects to engage with you (convert)
5. Processes you can put in place to share even more valuable content with your prospects
5. The interactive workshop will last 2 hours and we will provide you with a worksheet pack for you to use on your business.

The workshop will be punctuated by both pizza AND beer/soft drinks to allow you to "network" at the end of the session (whatever that means...) with the marketing legend in attendance. 

We will see you on the 5th! 

Best, 

Giorgia & Tom C
